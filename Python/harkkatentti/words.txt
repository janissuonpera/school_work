of the neanderthals qv an intermediate race that extended from
england to hungary at least and were the tjrpical savage
of paleolithic limes they were men of a species homo

inferior in phvsique as in mind to the neolithic men

in height but they had not yet acquired a fully

of the mous terian period show little advance over the
pre ceding culture but bter the increased employ ment al

stone age this is known as the aungnacian culture and
is attributed to the immigration into western europe of a
race of men probably from the southeast as aurignacian relics
are found on all the shores around the mediter ranean
